# text_based_cluedo
This was an assignment for the SWEN222 course at Victoria University- In pairs we had to 
create a text based version of the boardgame "Cluedo". I worked with Raymond Gueze and this
is the Java source code for the project. It works reasonably, but is far from perfect or bug free.
